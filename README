dirty_after_save
================

This simple gem adds support to all ActiveRecord models in your application to track
the changes made to a record before it was saved. Standard Rails forgets this
information as soon as save is called.

To access all changed attributes after save has been called, use

  Model#changed_attributes_before_save

To access changes in individual fields, append the suffix '_change_before_save', i.e.

  Model#field_change_before_save

To figure out if a field was changed, append the suffix '_changed_before_save?', i.e.

  Model#field_changed_before_save?

That's it. Enjoy.
